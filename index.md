## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs
  Lab #1
This is one of my favorite labs because it was the first actual time I was ever able to understand the work given to me. I had also never done any coding prior to this lab and it was a great way to start the year.

  Lab #6
This is one of my favorite labs because I was able to code a game of blackjack and got to better understand how to play a game of blackjack. I was also able to fully understand the coding that needed to be done compared to understanding only half of the work.

  Lab#9
This is one of my favorite labs because I enjoyed making a spelling game and a secret number game. It wasn't easy but it was entertaining to figure out how to do. It helped me improve some of my coding skills that needed to be fixed.
