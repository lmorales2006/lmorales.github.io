## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs
*Lab #1
This is one of my favorite labs because it was the first actual time I was ever able to understand the work given to me. I had also never done any coding prior to this lab and it was a great way to start the year. https://github.com/cpsc-fall-2024/cpsc-120-cpsc-120-lab-01-cpsc-120-prompt-lab-01

*Lab #6
This is one of my favorite labs because I was able to code a game of blackjack and got to better understand how to play a game of blackjack. I was also able to fully understand the coding that needed to be done compared to understanding only half of the work. https://github.com/cpsc-fall-2024/cpsc-120-cpsc-120-lab-06-cpsc-120-prompt-lab-06
*Lab#9
This is one of my favorite labs because I enjoyed making a spelling game and a secret number game. It wasn't easy but it was entertaining to figure out how to do. It helped me improve some of my coding skills that needed to be fixed. https://github.com/cpsc-fall-2024/cpsc-120-cpsc-120-lab-09-cpsc-120-prompt-lab-09
